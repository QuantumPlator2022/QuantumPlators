# QuantumPlators**
#Import libraries properly. The libraries that we are importing are as follows :- 
#•	Numpy
#•	Opencv-python
#•	Qiskit
#•	PIL and Math 
#If you haven’t installed them fire the command
#pip install <libraries you want to installed> (in windows)
      For eg :- 
				pip install opencv-python 

$ sudo apt-get install git(in ubuntu)
$ git clone <link of the libraries you want to install>(in ubuntu)
For eg :- 
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
OR
conda install <libraries you want to installed>
After checking the proper installation of these libraries 
Make sure to download 12 videos of traffics containing vehicles and Pedestrians (Same video will work too but then it needs to be short, about 1 -5 mins long, and to contain vehicles- 4-wheeler, two wheelers and Pedestrians); 
Make sure to have Geographical location (in X and Y Coordinates, float datatype);
Make sure to have the State of the Cardinal Node in Boolean Values (i.e.  0 or 1).

Run the Main.py and feed in the values as the program asks you about the values.
In the end The Program will print out the State our Traffic light (Selected traffic light should be in)

Let us try to verbalize this growing issue and also to provide a solution; Solution which will hopefully contribute in changing this grave state of the problem. To resolve the issue of vehicle queuing caused by prolonged traffic light state switching time at a busy intersection and attempt to suggest a solution dealing with manipulation of traffic lights utilizing Quantum gate modelling to reduce logistics/transportation congestions and to offer a practical solution for the optimization of traffic flow in order to minimize the amount of time required for a certain set of vehicles.
That was Huge. Let’s break it down into chunks. We are trying to solve the traffic queueing on an intersection or a busy intersection by controlling traffic lights. We will control and determine state of traffic lights, states, AKA, red, yellow or green light by quantum gate modeling.  Which will hopefully optimize traffic flow, reduce traffic congestions and to minimize the time wasted in traffic. One might wonder about the purpose of this problem to them. We chose this problem due to a series of issues, including extra travel times for drivers and passengers increased fuel prices and increased fuel consumption. Higher greenhouse gasses emissions and also accidents.
In our humble opinion, quantum computing and quantum gate modeling in specific possesses the ability to solve this issue. Well, why so? Because due to the virtue of a quantum bit or a qubit and quantum gate architecture, it allows the solution to be universal with the help of Unitary gates that we are using| and also to compute fast. Quantum gates have an immense potential to scale. We could even use the infrastructure of Hadoop for the scalability purpose. Quantum gate modeling also enables fault tolerance simply put error correction. So less chances of quantum decoherences.
